He was arrested in a raid in Dhaka&#8217;s Tejgaon industrial area on Saturday. During initial interrogation, Riaz confessed to the police about killing Rekha.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Confirming the information about the arrest, Sub-Inspector (SI) Kulaura Police Station Abdur Rahim told Prothom Alo on the phone on Sunday morning that during the interrogation, Riaz said that after the divorce, he was talking about marriage with another man. He could not accept it. For that reason, he called Rekha to the forest next to the house and killed her by hanging a veil around her neck saying &#8216;If I don&#8217;t get it, no one else will get it&#8217;. Then he tied the body to a tree and went into hiding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SI Abdur Rahim said that Riyaz was arrested yesterday at around 11 pm after knowing the location with the help of information technology. He will be sent to Moulvibazar court.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rekha Begum is the daughter of day laborer Ruhul Amin, a resident of Paschim Singur area of \u200b\u200bBaramchal Union of Upazila. Riaz Uddin is the son of Salim Mia from the same area. Riaz and Rekha got married about 10 months ago. Riaz&#8217;s elder brother lives in Dhaka. After marriage he moved there with his wife.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the affidavit of the murder case, it is known that Riaz Uddin used to consume drugs in Dhaka and often physically and mentally abused his wife. In this situation, local arbitration took place about two months ago. In the arbitration Riaz informed the wife about the decision of divorce. At this time, he gave 50,000 taka as a dowry. On March 27, no other family member was at home except Rekha. At that time, some people around saw Rekha walking towards the forest with Riaz. Since then they were not found. Rekha&#8217;s body was found tied with a veil to a tree in the deep forest near the house in Grizing Nayabagan area on 29th noon. On receiving the information, the police went to the spot and recovered the body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On that day and night, Rekha&#8217;s father Ruhul Amin filed a murder case accusing Riaz and his father Salim Mia (58) as the plaintiff. About two years ago, a police case was registered against Riaz for raping a four-year-old child. After serving a few months in jail in that case, he was released on bail.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The police arrested her ex-husband Riaz Uddin (24) for his involvement in the murder of teenager Rekha Begum (15) in Kulaura Upazila of Moulvibazar.
