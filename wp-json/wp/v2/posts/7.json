Again, it may offer to earn thousands of dollars directly. Everything will be said in English. A few seconds of talk will make them seem fake. Calling the mobile number back will not go through.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, many customers are receiving such phone calls from the numbers of other mobile operators including state-owned Teletalk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ramisa Islam, a teacher at a private university, received such phone calls twice on the same day from two different Teletalk numbers. He was asked for the first time in English whether he was a feminist or not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ramisa told Prothom Alo that she cut the call after realizing the strange call. When he called again from another number, he was asked if he knew English or not. This time too he cut. Later both the numbers were found closed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently this reporter received such a call from a teletalk number. When you pick up the call, someone directly says in English, &#8216;The reason I&#8217;m calling is because there are jobs online where you can earn $2,000 a day.&#8217;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The call is cut off when the identity of the caller is asked. Calling back immediately turns the number off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teletalk Managing Director AKM Habibur Rahman was called to inquire about this. The message is sent. But no response was received.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several people reported receiving such calls from mobile operator Robi numbers as well. They have the same experience. They are offered attractive job offers by speaking English. Later the number is found closed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robi&#8217;s Chief Corporate and Regulatory Officer Saheed Alam told Prothom Alo that spoofing or harassing calls are often not blocked due to technical reasons. Customer awareness is most needed to prevent such calls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least seven people who received such calls told Prothom Alo that they were told by the &#8216;offer&#8217; to earn dollars that they would need some documents to join this work. Sometimes they may provide links.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It often happens that people grab money to get lured by tempting offers. However, it is known from customers that the number of such phone calls has increased recently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secretary of Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC). Nurul Hafiz told Prothom Alo that they will look into it if any organization is asked for cooperation. Also talk to the operators.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A phone call may first ask if you are a &#8216;feminist&#8217;.
