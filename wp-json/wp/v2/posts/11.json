They were arrested in a raid in Siddhirganj of Narayanganj last Saturday. The arrested persons are Kamrul Hasan (65) and his son Md. Fahad Hasan Siam (27). DB said four mobile phones, visiting cards of various fake organizations, pad seals, two computers, fake appointment letters and visas for sending abroad were seized from them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dhaka Metropolitan Police Additional Commissioner (DB) Mohammad Haroon Or Rashid said this while talking to reporters at his office on Minto Road in the capital today. He said that in April 2020, Sahidul Islam, a resident of Sunamganj&#8217;s Chatak, met the two arrested. At one stage of the introduction, Kamrul Hasan said, many people will be appointed under the army officially in Turkey, he can send Sahidul there. Sahidul will go to Turkey and get good salary by doing this job. Sahidul agreed to Kamrul&#8217;s proposal. However, Kamrul said that Sahidul will have to pay Tk 7 lakh to go to Turkey. Initially, he gave three and a half lakh taka to Kamrul.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This father and son of Narayanganj trapped 19 more people like Sahidul. DB official Harun-or-Rashid said, according to the agreement, on May 7, 2020, Kamrul and his son were paid 20 lakh 230 thousand taka. After giving the money, their health check-up (medical) is done. After a few days, Kamrul and Siam told everyone that now people cannot be sent to Turkey. So all of them will be sent to different countries including Malaysia, Serbia. Saying this, Kamrul and Siam took another 32 lakh 30 thousand taka from them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the press conference, Haroon-or-Rashid also said that Kamrul and Siam could not send anyone abroad by taking money from them. They took the money and ran away from their warri&#8217;s office. Basically, the victims gave money to Warri&#8217;s office. After taking the money, the father and son stopped communicating with the common people. If someone wants money back, they threaten in various ways. At one point they secretly changed their offices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a press conference, DB said that Kamrul and his son Siam used to tell the victims that they had valid licenses of four to five recruiting agencies. Actually they have no license. Various establishments were opened using fake license numbers. Apart from this, they used to rent offices in various commercial areas for credibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How Kamrul became a fraud<\/strong><br>, DB said in the press conference, Kamrul Hasan spent 10 years in Malaysia from 1998. After returning home, he worked in a recruiting agency named Al-Rifat International since 2001. After the agency&#8217;s owner died in 2022, he began defrauding the agency by pretending to be himself. By cheating, he has taken money from about 1,500 people who are interested in going abroad by telling them to send people to Turkey, Canada, Serbia, Malaysia and other countries. He took 10,000 rupees from each of them saying that they would undergo medical treatment. This father and son took from 12 lakhs to 30-35 lakhs from everyone talking about the visa process.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dhaka Metropolitan Detective Police (DB) has arrested a father and son on the charge of embezzling large amount of money from 20 persons for recruiting people under the Turkish army.
