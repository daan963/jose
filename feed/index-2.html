<p>A phone call may first ask if you are a &#8216;feminist&#8217;. Again, it may offer to earn thousands of dollars directly. Everything will be said in English. A few seconds of talk will make them seem fake. Calling the mobile number back will not go through.</p>



<p>Recently, many customers are receiving such phone calls from the numbers of other mobile operators including state-owned Teletalk.</p>



<p>Ramisa Islam, a teacher at a private university, received such phone calls twice on the same day from two different Teletalk numbers. He was asked for the first time in English whether he was a feminist or not.</p>



<p>Ramisa told Prothom Alo that she cut the call after realizing the strange call. When he called again from another number, he was asked if he knew English or not. This time too he cut. Later both the numbers were found closed.</p>



<p>Recently this reporter received such a call from a teletalk number. When you pick up the call, someone directly says in English, &#8216;The reason I&#8217;m calling is because there are jobs online where you can earn $2,000 a day.&#8217;</p>



<p>The call is cut off when the identity of the caller is asked. Calling back immediately turns the number off.</p>



<p>Teletalk Managing Director AKM Habibur Rahman was called to inquire about this. The message is sent. But no response was received.</p>



<p>Several people reported receiving such calls from mobile operator Robi numbers as well. They have the same experience. They are offered attractive job offers by speaking English. Later the number is found closed.</p>



<p>Robi&#8217;s Chief Corporate and Regulatory Officer Saheed Alam told Prothom Alo that spoofing or harassing calls are often not blocked due to technical reasons. Customer awareness is most needed to prevent such calls.</p>



<p>At least seven people who received such calls told Prothom Alo that they were told by the &#8216;offer&#8217; to earn dollars that they would need some documents to join this work. Sometimes they may provide links.</p>



<p>It often happens that people grab money to get lured by tempting offers. However, it is known from customers that the number of such phone calls has increased recently.</p>



<p>Secretary of Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC). Nurul Hafiz told Prothom Alo that they will look into it if any organization is asked for cooperation. Also talk to the operators.</p>

<p>The police arrested her ex-husband Riaz Uddin (24) for his involvement in the murder of teenager Rekha Begum (15) in Kulaura Upazila of Moulvibazar. He was arrested in a raid in Dhaka&#8217;s Tejgaon industrial area on Saturday. During initial interrogation, Riaz confessed to the police about killing Rekha.</p>



<p>Confirming the information about the arrest, Sub-Inspector (SI) Kulaura Police Station Abdur Rahim told Prothom Alo on the phone on Sunday morning that during the interrogation, Riaz said that after the divorce, he was talking about marriage with another man. He could not accept it. For that reason, he called Rekha to the forest next to the house and killed her by hanging a veil around her neck saying &#8216;If I don&#8217;t get it, no one else will get it&#8217;. Then he tied the body to a tree and went into hiding.</p>



<p>SI Abdur Rahim said that Riyaz was arrested yesterday at around 11 pm after knowing the location with the help of information technology. He will be sent to Moulvibazar court.</p>



<p>Rekha Begum is the daughter of day laborer Ruhul Amin, a resident of Paschim Singur area of ​​Baramchal Union of Upazila. Riaz Uddin is the son of Salim Mia from the same area. Riaz and Rekha got married about 10 months ago. Riaz&#8217;s elder brother lives in Dhaka. After marriage he moved there with his wife.</p>



<p>According to the affidavit of the murder case, it is known that Riaz Uddin used to consume drugs in Dhaka and often physically and mentally abused his wife. In this situation, local arbitration took place about two months ago. In the arbitration Riaz informed the wife about the decision of divorce. At this time, he gave 50,000 taka as a dowry. On March 27, no other family member was at home except Rekha. At that time, some people around saw Rekha walking towards the forest with Riaz. Since then they were not found. Rekha&#8217;s body was found tied with a veil to a tree in the deep forest near the house in Grizing Nayabagan area on 29th noon. On receiving the information, the police went to the spot and recovered the body.</p>



<p>On that day and night, Rekha&#8217;s father Ruhul Amin filed a murder case accusing Riaz and his father Salim Mia (58) as the plaintiff. About two years ago, a police case was registered against Riaz for raping a four-year-old child. After serving a few months in jail in that case, he was released on bail.</p>

<p>The gang members first lured the parents whose children are studying in schools and colleges by promising them stipend money. After gaining trust, called and told the result by adding and subtracting the Financial Service (MFS) number on the mobile with different numbers. As the pin number is not asked directly, the affected parents are giving the result after addition and subtraction in good faith. By this novel trick, the gang was stealing money from the MFS account of the guardian by knowing the PIN number.</p>



<p>In the case of withdrawing 2 lakh 80 thousand rupees from the MFS account by cheating a victim&#8217;s parent by promising to give stipend money. Sajjat ​​Howladar (26) has been arrested by the Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DB). He was arrested from the capital&#8217;s Hatirjheel police station on Saturday. At that time, three mobile phones and three SIM cards were recovered from him.</p>



<p>DB says, the arrested Sajjat ​​is a resident of Faridpur. He worked as a mason in Dhaka. In order to earn more money with less effort, Sajjat ​​along with his friends of the same age in the area developed the strategy of embezzling money from mobile accounts. Later they formed a syndicate and stole lakhs of rupees.</p>



<p>Additional Commissioner (DB) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police Mohammad Harun Or Rashid told the journalists at his office on Minto Road in the capital this Sunday afternoon. He said the victim, a lawyer&#8217;s daughter, passed the HSC examination last year with GPA-5. On January 22, the lawyer received a message on his phone. It is said that his daughter will get a stipend of Rs 5,200 per month for good results. For this a phone number is asked to be contacted. Accordingly, on January 23, when he called the designated number, the other end said that it was Bakshibazar Education Board&#8217;s office. At that time, his daughter will receive a stipend of 5,200 taka per month for seven months and 12,500 taka per month from one year to three years, the members of the circle said on the phone.</p>



<p>Haroon Or Rashid said that the gang member wanted to know the victim&#8217;s bank name, account number and branch name. For the account in which daughter&#8217;s stipend will be deposited, ask for an MFS number and daughter&#8217;s mobile number and NID number. At one stage he called and asked to see the calculator on the mobile phone. If asked to know the sum by adding a certain number to another number and the victim&#8217;s PIN, the victim gives the sum. In this way, knowing the PIN number, the members of the gang grabbed the money.</p>

<p>Dhaka Metropolitan Detective Police (DB) has arrested a father and son on the charge of embezzling large amount of money from 20 persons for recruiting people under the Turkish army. They were arrested in a raid in Siddhirganj of Narayanganj last Saturday. The arrested persons are Kamrul Hasan (65) and his son Md. Fahad Hasan Siam (27). DB said four mobile phones, visiting cards of various fake organizations, pad seals, two computers, fake appointment letters and visas for sending abroad were seized from them.</p>



<p>Dhaka Metropolitan Police Additional Commissioner (DB) Mohammad Haroon Or Rashid said this while talking to reporters at his office on Minto Road in the capital today. He said that in April 2020, Sahidul Islam, a resident of Sunamganj&#8217;s Chatak, met the two arrested. At one stage of the introduction, Kamrul Hasan said, many people will be appointed under the army officially in Turkey, he can send Sahidul there. Sahidul will go to Turkey and get good salary by doing this job. Sahidul agreed to Kamrul&#8217;s proposal. However, Kamrul said that Sahidul will have to pay Tk 7 lakh to go to Turkey. Initially, he gave three and a half lakh taka to Kamrul.</p>



<p>This father and son of Narayanganj trapped 19 more people like Sahidul. DB official Harun-or-Rashid said, according to the agreement, on May 7, 2020, Kamrul and his son were paid 20 lakh 230 thousand taka. After giving the money, their health check-up (medical) is done. After a few days, Kamrul and Siam told everyone that now people cannot be sent to Turkey. So all of them will be sent to different countries including Malaysia, Serbia. Saying this, Kamrul and Siam took another 32 lakh 30 thousand taka from them.</p>



<p>In the press conference, Haroon-or-Rashid also said that Kamrul and Siam could not send anyone abroad by taking money from them. They took the money and ran away from their warri&#8217;s office. Basically, the victims gave money to Warri&#8217;s office. After taking the money, the father and son stopped communicating with the common people. If someone wants money back, they threaten in various ways. At one point they secretly changed their offices.</p>



<p>In a press conference, DB said that Kamrul and his son Siam used to tell the victims that they had valid licenses of four to five recruiting agencies. Actually they have no license. Various establishments were opened using fake license numbers. Apart from this, they used to rent offices in various commercial areas for credibility.</p>



<p><strong>How Kamrul became a fraud</strong><br>, DB said in the press conference, Kamrul Hasan spent 10 years in Malaysia from 1998. After returning home, he worked in a recruiting agency named Al-Rifat International since 2001. After the agency&#8217;s owner died in 2022, he began defrauding the agency by pretending to be himself. By cheating, he has taken money from about 1,500 people who are interested in going abroad by telling them to send people to Turkey, Canada, Serbia, Malaysia and other countries. He took 10,000 rupees from each of them saying that they would undergo medical treatment. This father and son took from 12 lakhs to 30-35 lakhs from everyone talking about the visa process.</p>
